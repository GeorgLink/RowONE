## T4: Key Partners & Website Design

Team Leader - Monique Gustafson

### **Key partners**

We are going to be partners with a majority of sporting goods stores, 
as they will supply our inventory with equipment we need, and help with minor 
maintenance and wear and tear if needed. We will refer to actual manufacturers 
when it comes to major damage and repair.


* *REI* 
* *Cabela's* 
* *Dick's Sporting Goods* 
* *Bass Pro Shops*
* *SCHEELS*

We will also be partnering with service enablers. These entities will help get our business on the market, with creating a website, and getting our name out there, so when someone searches keywords like “kayak, paddle board, rafting, water sports” our business will pop up.

* *Google*
* *Yelp*
* *Foursquare*
* *Facebook*
* *Instagram*
* *Twitter*

Not to mention National, City, and State Parks. We will need a good relationship with them to get permission to work near the lakes, 
rivers and oceans. We want to abide all the laws and regulations there are to operate.
