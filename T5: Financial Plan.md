Team Leader: Adam Strasser

### Cost Structure ###
	
RowONE is looking to start smaller and build a bigger presence as we grow our numbers. 
Starting our business would need to be done by acquiring a loan and through investors. 
This loan will jump start our success and give us more room to get our name out there. 
Our expected costs will depend on the amount loaned to us; however, here is how the cost percentages should look:

Running the Website: 5%

Advertising: 10%

Maintenance and Repairs: 15%

Buying Equipment: 30%

Employee Pay: 40%


We expect to provide our investors with 20% of our profits. 
Based on our growth and how much equipment is still in good condition, 
the 30% for buying equipment may change along with the 15% for repairs.

Our main business is to provide customers with equipment that we purchase from a business partner, so buying equipment would be the second highest amount of cost. Also, the payment for employees, especially  for technology experts, is important to do our business; therefore, it accounts for 40%.

### Revenue Streams ###

Our profits will primarily be acquired through online and on-site rentals. 
Our costs will increase by the amount of time people spend using our equipment. 
Advertising, rental stands on site, and word of mouth is what will get our name out there. 
Revenue will also come from customers if they happen to break the equipment.

### Final Costs ###

While we cannot give a conclusive answer to how much money we are expected to earn 
(primarily based on the amount loaned and from investors), 
we can confidently say that we are projected to be very successful within the three year time period.
