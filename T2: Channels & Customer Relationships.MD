### **T2: Channels & Customer Relationships**

Team Leader - Chase Pederson

#### *Marketing* 

Raise awareness through advertisements, online, and on waterfront.
Less focus on television ads as our consumers likely donâ€™t watch a lot of TV.
Using Social Networking Services (SNS)(i.e. facebook, twitter, instagram) to advertise our business because we target young customers, and SNS is free.
Build relationships with local sporting goods businesses, so they can also recommend or let their customers know about our services. Using sponsorships with high profile celebrities and role models will also help us expand on spreading information, especially with athletes well known in the water sports industry.

#### *Rating System*

In app/on website ability to rate products to show quality.
Its rating is made public so that customers can see rates and comments (like the situation we buy product online in Amazon) 
Point of Purchase
In app, on website to provide easily accessible, and in person at rental machines.
Handle with many languages (spanish, chinese, franch, etc.) because we target people from all over the world - using technology to translate English into other languages.
 
#### *Deliver value*

Customers can see the stock of paddleboards, kayaks and canoes in app/on website
Refer-a-friend program: Tell a friend about our business (recommend to try) and the person who introduces to the friend can get coupon, or special bundle rentals, for example rent up to four kayaks at full price and get an extra rental for free for duration of original rental. Rewards program, for loyal customers who rent from us more frequently than others, allows people to earn rewards such as souvenirs (ie stickers, koozies, t-shirts etc), or discounts on future rentals.


#### *Customer Support*

 Contact Us system with email, text support, and 24/7 bot system to help with issues with technology
 
 
### **Customer Relationships**

#### *Type of Relationship*

We maintain a short-term to long-term relationship with our customers.

#### *Usage of said relationship*

Short-term: The short-term customer relationship is just renting out water sports devices. They pick up a device and use it for the day and return it at the end of their use. It is simple just as a movie store rents out videos and movies/games.

Long-term: Our relationship to our customers long term is that they will get connected with each other. We could organize sponsored events to bring people together and have them use our products and become attatched to them and the community. With that we will be able to keep customers in our loop with new events for water sports.

#### *Direct Personal assistance*

There will be online customer support for anyone who is having troubles, but there will also be buildings in select areas that will be able to assist on-site. Our website will have a trouble shooting page that would assist customers further by showing them issues that others may have had and got solved.
