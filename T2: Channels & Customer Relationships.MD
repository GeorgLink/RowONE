Team Leader - Chase Pederson

#### *Marketing* 

Raise awareness through advertisements, online, and on waterfront.
Less focus on television ads as our consumers likely donâ€™t watch a lot of TV.
Using Social Networking Services (SNS)(i.e. facebook, twitter, instagram) to advertise our business because we target young customers, and SNS is free.
Build relationships with local sporting goods businesses, so they can also recommend or let their customers know about our services. Using sponsorships with high profile celebrities and role models will also help us expand on spreading information, especially with athletes well known in the water sports industry.

#### *Rating System*

In app/on website ability to rate products to show quality.
Its rating is made public so that customers can see rates and comments (like the situation we buy product online in Amazon) 
Point of Purchase
In app, on website to provide easily accessible, and in person at rental machines.
Handle with many languages (spanish, chinese, franch, etc.) because we target people from all over the world - using technology to translate English into other languages.
 
#### *Deliver value*

Customers can see the stock of paddleboards, kayaks and canoes in app/on website
Refer-a-friend program: Tell a friend about our business (recommend to try) and the person who introduces to the friend can get coupon, or special bundle rentals, for example rent up to four kayaks at full price and get an extra rental for free for duration of original rental. Rewards program, for loyal customers who rent from us more frequently than others, allows people to earn rewards such as souvenirs (ie stickers, koozies, t-shirts etc), or discounts on future rentals.


#### *Customer Support*

 Contact Us system with email, text support, and 24/7 bot system to help with issues with technology
 
 
### **Customer Relationships**

#### *Type of Relationship*

We maintain a short-term to long-term relationship with our customers.

#### *Usage of said relationship*

Short-term: This is for those who are using our services as a temporary means to partake in the activities on the water. This is temporary because they either plan on rarely partaking in the activities, or they eventually plan to buy their own equipment in the future.

Long-term: This is for our customers who do not want to and/or cannot afford, house, or take care of their own equipment. We offer an easy alternative to those who want to partake in the water activities, but who may not be able to maintain ownership of their own equipment.

#### *Direct Personal assistance*

There will be online customer support for anyone who is having troubles, but there will also be buildings in select areas that will be able to assist on-site. If there is not a building in that area and the issue cannot be resolved through customer support (or the patron wants to speak in person), then we will send a technician in the local area to assist.
