### *Business partners*

Our business includes providing products to users, delivering them to users, and carrying out maintenance of products. We do not either produce the water sport equipment , deliver them, or maintain them; instead, we manage these as a series of business procedures. We cooperate with companies for manufacturing, delivering, and maintaining these products. If users try to go through these processes by themselves, it is very difficult and expensive for them. Our business acts as a mediator between each sector. Our connections build a bridge between producing the product, delivering it, and keeping up that maintenance of said product. We act as a middleman for each section, and this ensures that we can handle the leasing prices for customers. This business model not only helps users to get equipment as cheap as possible, but also have benefits for our business partners. We are not only giving customers a brief sample of our business partners’ products, we are also advertising to increase their sales as well, so it is beneficial for both sides in the event our consumers wish to purchase their own equipment. Since we are developing and maintaining the app and website that collect customers’ comments or rates towards a product, we share those valuable information with business partners. As a result, business partners can also make a profit by providing products or services that are specifically tailored to the user’s needs. We are in a win-win situation.

### **Key partners**

We are going to be partners with a majority of sporting goods stores, 
as they will supply our inventory with equipment we need, and help with minor 
maintenance and wear and tear if needed. We will refer to actual manufacturers 
when it comes to major damage and repair.

* *Bass Pro Shops*
* *SCHEELS*

We will also be partnering with service enablers. These entities will help get our business on the market, with creating a website, and getting our name out there, so when someone searches keywords like “kayak, paddle board, rafting, water sports” our business will pop up.

Not to mention National, City, and State Parks. We will need a good relationship with them to get permission to work near the lakes, 
rivers and oceans. We want to abide all the laws and regulations there are to operate.
