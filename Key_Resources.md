### **Key Resources**

#### *Business partners*

Our business includes providing products to users, delivering them to users, and carrying out maintenance of products. We do not either produce the water sport equipment , deliver them, or maintain them; instead, we manage these as a series of business procedures. We cooperate with companies for manufacturing, delivering, and maintaining these products. If users try to go through these processes by themselves, it is very difficult and expensive for them. Our business acts as a mediator between each sector. Our connections build a bridge between producing the product, delivering it, and keeping up that maintenance of said product. We act as a middleman for each section, and this ensures that we can handle the leasing prices for customers. This business model not only helps users to get equipment as cheap as possible, but also have benefits for our business partners. We are not only giving customers a brief sample of our business partners’ products, we are also advertising to increase their sales as well, so it is beneficial for both sides in the event our consumers wish to purchase their own equipment. Since we are developing and maintaining the app and website that collect customers’ comments or rates towards a product, we share those valuable information with business partners. As a result, business partners can also make a profit by providing products or services that are specifically tailored to the user’s needs. We are in a win-win situation.

#### *Assets*

Providing a cheaper and more accessible way to rent water equipment is a major part of our business, we will be working with many businesses directly to cut down the costs. Our business partners play a major role in our company by providing their products or delivering the products from our facilities to the consumer’s location. The products will be acquired through business deals, and we will be renting them to consumers. We will need people to operate and fix any technical difficulties with our app and website since we are mainly an online company. Although we are primarily online-based, we also have on-site locations in popular spots. This is to more easily maintain and and out equipment rather than delivering it.

#### *Technology*

Our company will need a server to house our customer’s data and purchases. This also means that we need a network of computers at our facilities. These computers will have app and website development tools as well as tools to handle the customer’s data.
