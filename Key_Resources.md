#### *Business Partners* ####

Our business includes providing products to users, delivering them to users, and carrying out maintenance of products. We do not either
produce the water sport equipment , deliver them, or maintain them; instead, we manage these as a series of business procedures. We
cooperate with companies for manufacturing, delivering, and maintaining these products. If users try to go through these processes by
themselves, it is very difficult and expensive for them

#### *Assets*

We own all of our eqiupment. Though we store it in warehouse in which we rent for the time being. 
We will be working with many businesses directly to cut down the costs. Our business partners play a major role in our company by 
providing their products, and helping with advertisements, or recommendations to customers.

#### *Technology*

Our company will need a server to house our customer’s data and purchases. This also means that we need a network of computers at our facilities. These computers will have app and website development tools as well as tools to handle the customers’ data.
