### **Key Resources**

* *Physical* - goods, stores, computer, server, network
* *Intellectual* - customer database, logos, website, apps, partnership
* *Human* - engineers/technical experts, business partners
* *Financial* - cash, credit, stock 

#### *Assets*

Providing a cheaper and more accessible way to rent water equipment is a major part of our business, we will be working with many businesses directly to cut down the costs. Our business partners play a major role in our company by providing their products or delivering the products from our facilities to the consumer’s location. The products will be acquired through business deals, and we will be renting them to consumers. We will need people to operate and fix any technical difficulties with our app and website since we are mainly an online company. Although we are primarily online-based, we also have on-site locations in popular spots. This is to more easily maintain and and out equipment rather than delivering it.

#### *Technology*

Our company will need a server to house our customer’s data and purchases. This also means that we need a network of computers at our facilities. These computers will have app and website development tools as well as tools to handle the customer’s data.
