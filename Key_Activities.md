### **Key Activities**

#### *Platform for customers to use (App and website)*

Our business will develop applications for smartphone users and establish an Internet website so that customers can borrow equipment for water sport activities - surfboards, wakeboards, paddle boards, canoes, or kayaks. In both the app and website, customers can search what they want to rent by putting a few words in the search box, and they are able to quickly pick up equipment from the categories (i.e. surfboards, wakeboards, paddle boards, canoes, or kayaks). They can also check rates and comments before deciding to borrow products. We also have a wide variety of different brands per sporting equipment, so preference is definitely encouraged for our more selective customers. We value their opinion and want to provide them with the best of the best. 

In the smartphone app, there is a notification function telling customers valuable information such as discount, sale, invents, etc. Our business creates value by providing much cheaper water sports equipment for users who are not able to afford other products. These services contribute to solving customer problems because customers can compare the cost, condition, experience with the seller of equipment in the app or web. This means they can choose the products that meet their needs. All customers need to enroll their email before using services as it helps us maintain customer relationships too. Creating an account in our online website will further help us assist our customers because our online website saves past rentals and recommend other equipment for faster rentals. For people who are new to the water sports industry, we also provide online information and physical pamphlets that give a brief breakdown of how to use and take proper care of our equipment so it can be used to the max potential and returned in the condition it was rented.
