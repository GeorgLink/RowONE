*RowONE* is a company based in the coasts of the United States, renting a water sport recreational equipment at a lower cost. Our business provides customers more opportunities to enjoy aquatic sports by being engaged in buying, housing, maintaining, and transporting goods on behalf of the customers.

### Overview of Business

We are the first, and only, water sport recreational equipment rental business. We are revolutionizing the way people rent water sports equipment. We are an online business that offers the equipment at the waterfront of most beaches, lakes, and rivers.  If we don’t have a kiosk/rack/locker at the waterfront you’re going to, let us know and we’ll transport the equipment to your location, or your destination.  We offer a smartphone app so you can easily locate our kiosks/racks/lockers and make sure the equipment is available. We believe our customers deserve a convenient, easy, and hassle-free way to have fun. However there are also ramifications for the damage of our equipment, which we follow/track by account information and the serial numbers of the equipment rented that we assign to each customer based off of the account.


Our initial line of products and service include surfboards, wakeboards, paddleboards, kayaks, and canoes. These are readily available and accessible from the waterfront, which are in electronic kiosks/racks/lockers. They will be able to select the piece of equipment they want to rent from their phones, or the screens on the kiosks, and purchase the rental. It will then be dispensed. A customer will be charged by the half hour.  We will have employees that provide the upkeep and maintenance of an item.
Within the next 5 years, our business is expected to grow in terms of the amount of kiosks/racks/lockers around the nation, and how much equipment they hold.
