### **Value Propositions**

This is an entirely new service that customers previously didn’t know they wanted or needed, because it wasn’t available. 
There is no similar offering.  We are allowing customers access to our surfboards, wakeboards, paddleboards, kayaks, and canoes on the 
waterfront.  This gets rid of the need to buy, house, maintain, and transport their own aquatic gear.  It allows them to save time and 
money. It dramatically increases our customer's accessibility to aquatic recreational equipment, with the added convenience of being right 
on the waterfront, and it is easy to rent.

#### How are we different than a normal rental facility ####

We have user friendly interface, websites and apps for easy access to our available equipment. We have self service kiosks at multiple
locations. For areas that don't have a kiosk we offer delivery and pick up service. No need to borrow or rent a vehicle to haul awkwardly
shaped kayaks, canoes, and rafts.
