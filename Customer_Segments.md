### **Customer Segment**

Our target customers are anyone from the age of 18 and up (for legal reasons), who live an active lifestyle or intend to make healthier choices. We target all income levels: the lower class, who might not be able to afford purchasing surfboards, wakeboards, paddle boards, canoes, or kayaks, this provides them with the opportunity to pursue multiple extracurricular activities at a reasonable cost. For the middle to high class, they just might not feel like owning, housing, maintaining and transporting their own equipment, so this provides them the opportunity to enjoy these activities without all of the responsibilities. 

We are specifically and solely specialized in the outdoor fitness and aquatic sports market. There are many people who exercise, compete in water sports, and those who just want to take something out on the water for relaxation and leisure.  Additionally, the surfing business will grow within a few years because surfing has become an Olympic sport for Tokyo2020.  We expect more people to visit the US to go surfing, and our project will be a great business opportunity.

Our customers will be primarily based near the water. Our most successful locations will be by popular local lakes, rivers and oceans. This means that most of our customer base will be located on the coasts of the United States. There will be opportunity to branch into camping sites that sit on rivers and lakes to support another section of consumers. With both coastal and landlocked locations we will offer a service almost everywhere in the U.S..
